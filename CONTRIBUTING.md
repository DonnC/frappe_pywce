### Extending the WhatsApp Client Library
The core library `pywce.whatsapp` module provides direct API integration. If you'd like to add more features:
- Use the `WhatsApp` class in `pywce/modules/whatsapp/__init__.py` as your base.
- Add well-documented methods for new API endpoints.

### Adding New Pywce Features
The engine processes chatbot logic via templates. When adding new engine capabilities:
- Add corresponding engine logic in corresponding folder under `pywce/src/`.
- Document new template options or hooks clearly in `CHANGELOG` and or `README`.
